# API

All public API routes are versioned under `/v1`, except system endpoints. Responses use JSON and errors provide a stable code, a user-safe message, a request identifier, and optional field details.

## System

```text
GET /health
GET /ready
```

## Authentication

```text
POST /v1/auth/sign-up
POST /v1/auth/login
GET  /v1/auth/verify
GET  /v1/auth/google
GET  /v1/auth/callback
GET  /v1/auth/me
POST /v1/auth/logout
```

The backend owns the Supabase login flow and returns an opaque `motionly_session` HTTP-only cookie. Successful login responses also provide a session-bound CSRF token; clients must send it as `X-CSRF-Token` for cookie-authenticated mutations. Email signup requires verification in production. Supabase redirects confirmation links to `/v1/auth/verify?code=...`; the endpoint exchanges that PKCE code and creates the Motionly session. The Google endpoint starts a separate PKCE flow and accepts each stored attempt only once.

## Workspaces

```text
GET    /v1/workspaces
POST   /v1/workspaces
GET    /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId
PATCH  /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId
GET    /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/members
POST   /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/members
PATCH  /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/members/:userId
DELETE /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/members/:userId
```

## Projects

```text
GET    /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/projects
POST   /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/projects
GET    /v1/projects/:projectId
PATCH  /v1/projects/:projectId
DELETE /v1/projects/:projectId
```

A project is one mutable Motionly composition. Its editable source is two fields — `compositionHtml` and `timelineJs` — plus the canvas settings and the scene list the frontend renders with GSAP.

```json
{
  "name": "Launch Film",
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "fps": 60,
  "duration": 30,
  "scenes": [{ "id": "intro", "label": "Intro", "start": 0, "duration": 8, "accent": "#7c3aed" }],
  "compositionHtml": "<template><style>...</style>...</template>",
  "timelineJs": "export function buildTimeline(context) { ... }"
}
```

`PATCH` and `DELETE` requests include the caller's last-known `revision`. A stale write returns `409 Conflict` with `REVISION_CONFLICT` and `details.currentRevision`, so clients reload or reconcile instead of silently overwriting another edit. Deletion is a soft archive. Viewers may read projects; workspace owners and editors may mutate them.

## Assets

```text
GET    /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/assets
POST   /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/assets/uploads
PUT    /v1/assets/uploads/:uploadId/content
POST   /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/assets/uploads/:uploadId/complete
GET    /v1/assets/:assetId
GET    /v1/assets/:assetId/download
DELETE /v1/assets/:assetId
POST   /v1/projects/:projectId/assets
DELETE /v1/projects/:projectId/assets/:assetId
```

The V1 local-filesystem adapter returns a short-lived authenticated API upload URL. Send the exact declared bytes and content type to that URL, then call the completion endpoint; completion verifies size and SHA-256 before marking the asset `READY`. A future S3-compatible adapter can return a signed object URL without changing this three-step lifecycle.

Stored artifacts are read through `GET /v1/artifacts/:artifactId/download`.

## Cloud AI generation

```text
POST /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/generations
```

One endpoint drives the whole Motionly conversation: talking about an idea, creating a project, editing it, and repairing it after a renderer failure.

```json
{
  "message": "Make the headline larger and slow the intro.",
  "projectId": "9a4f2e10-7b53-4a1c-9f0d-2c8b6d5e1a33",
  "revision": 7,
  "runtimeError": { "message": "buildTimeline is not a function" }
}
```

Only `message` is required. Omit `projectId` for the first generation in a workspace — the request then creates the project. `revision` is the revision the client generated against and requires `projectId`. `runtimeError` reports a renderer failure and requires both `projectId` and `revision`. Unknown fields are rejected.

The endpoint needs an authenticated session, `X-CSRF-Token`, and workspace membership; viewers cannot generate. It is rate limited to 60 requests per minute per user. There is no `Idempotency-Key`, no job to poll, cancel, retry, or apply: one call returns the finished result.

| `data.type` | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chat` | 200 | Conversational reply in `message`. Nothing is written. |
| `plan` | 200 | Proposed approach in `message`. Nothing is written. |
| `generation` | 201 when `created` is `true`, otherwise 200 | The project was written. Carries `message`, `projectId`, `revision`, and `created`. |

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "generation",
    "message": "Made the headline larger and slowed the intro.",
    "projectId": "9a4f2e10-7b53-4a1c-9f0d-2c8b6d5e1a33",
    "revision": 8,
    "created": false
  }
}
```

| Error code | Status | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Malformed body, or `revision`/`runtimeError` sent without the fields they require. |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Viewer role. |
| `CSRF_INVALID` | 403 | Missing or wrong `X-CSRF-Token`. |
| `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | The caller is not a member of that workspace. |
| `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | The addressed project does not exist in that workspace. |
| `REVISION_CONFLICT` | 409 | The project moved while generating; `details.currentRevision` is the revision to reload. |
| `GENERATION_INVALID` | 422 | The model never produced valid source; `details.errors` lists the diagnostics. |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Per-user request limit. |
| `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | The model provider throttled the request. |
| `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` | 504 | The model did not answer in time. |
| `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | The provider is temporarily down. |
| `PROVIDER_*` | 502 | Any other provider failure. |

Behind the endpoint, a LangGraph workflow classifies the request, loads the project with the last twelve messages, selects Motionly skills, generates one schema-constrained candidate, validates it without executing it, and repairs a rejected candidate at most twice. A valid candidate replaces the addressed revision in one revision-checked transaction, or creates the project when none was addressed. Every turn is recorded in `messages`, and every attempt in `generation_runs`.

The provider is chosen by `AI_PROVIDER` with `AI_MODEL`; only the selected provider's API key is required. The backend never renders, previews, or exports — the frontend runs the generated source. Implementation detail lives in `cloud-ai-implementation.md`.

## Rendering

```text
GET  /v1/projects/:projectId/renders
POST /v1/projects/:projectId/renders
GET  /v1/renders/:renderId
POST /v1/renders/:renderId/cancel
POST /v1/renders/:renderId/retry
GET  /v1/renders/:renderId/artifacts
GET  /v1/render-artifacts/:artifactId/download
```

Render submission returns `202 Accepted`. Clients initially poll job state; server-sent events or WebSockets may be added later without changing the job model. Retryable mutations should accept idempotency keys.
